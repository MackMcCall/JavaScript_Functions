// BONUS Exercise 5: Data Plan Status
// Write a function that will display feedback on cell phone data usage.
// Cell phone plans for this particular company give you a certain amount of data every 30 days
// which must be used or they are lost (no rollover).
//We want to track the average amount of data used per day and inform the user if they are using too much data or can afford to use more.

// Write a function that accepts the following parameters:

// planLimit: amount of data in the plan per 30 day period
// day: the current day in the 30 day period
// usage: the total amount of data used so far
// The function should compute whether the user is over, under, or right on the average daily usage under the plan.
// It should also inform them of how much data is left and how much, on average, they can use per day for the rest of the month.
// If theyâ€™ve run out of data, it should inform them of that too.

// For example, if the user enters planLimit = 100, day = 15, and usage = 56, your program should print out something similar to the following.

// 15 days used, 15 days remaining
// Average daily use: 3.333 GB/day
// You are EXCEEDING your average daily use (3.73 GB/day),
// continuing this high usage, you'll exceed your data plan by
// 11.9 GB.
// To stay below your data plan, use no more than 2.93 GB/day.
